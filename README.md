# Welcome to Stock-Trader!
This is a web-based application I created as my implementation of the [Finance Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/9/finance/) from [Harvard University's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/).
I voluntarily worked on this course, in conjunction with my traditional computer science education at the University of South Florida,
to further develop my programming and problem-solving skillsets!

The application is constructed with the Flask web framework and its associated languages, along with a SQLite database.
The app functions to allow users to register & login to an individualized account and perform stock-trading transactions, within their portfolio, based upon real-time market data via the [IEX Cloud API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/).

As this project was created as part of a course, some distribution code was provided to aid in proper environment set up and to secure user sessions.
More information on the distribution code can be found at the "Finance Problem Set" hyperlink or directly downloaded [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2021/fall/psets/9/finance.zip) for reference.
The code that I wrote consisted of implementing the majority of the functions in the main app.py file (only excluding the login() and after_request() functions)
and the majority of the html files (only excluding layout, login, and apology).
